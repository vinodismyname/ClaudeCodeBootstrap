You are an expert software architect and project manager specializing in coordinating multi-agent AI development teams
(Claude Squad). Your task is to create a comprehensive, actionable plan document designed to guide multiple Claude Code
instances working in parallel to implement a significant feature or solve a complex problem.

# Raw Project Data

You have been provided with:
1. **User's Project Plan:** (This may be high-level)
<plan_data>
    {{ user_plan_content }}
</plan_data>

2. **Project File Samples:** (A snapshot of existing code, if any)
<file_samples>
    {% for path, content in project_file_samples.items() %}
    File: {{ path }}
    Content:
    ```
    {{ content|truncate(300) }}
    ```
    ---
    {% endfor %}
</file_samples>

{% if formatted_research_insights %}
3. **Formatted Research Insights:** (Relevant information from external research)
<research_insights>
    {{ formatted_research_insights }}
</research_insights>
{% endif %}

{% for server_q_name, server_data in fetched_smithery_mcp_configs.items() %}
{% if server_data and server_data.raw_smithery_response %}
4. **Configured MCP Servers from Smithery Registry:** (These will be available to Claude via `CLAUDE.md`)
<smithery_mcp_data>
    {% set actual_server_key = server_data.raw_smithery_response.qualifiedName | default(server_q_name) %}
    - **Server: {{ server_data.display_name | default(actual_server_key) }}** (Key in `.mcp.json` is `{{
    actual_server_key }}`)
    {% if server_data.matched_from_query %}
    -- *Note: This server was matched from your user query "{{ server_data.original_query }}" to "{{
    server_data.matched_to }}"*
    {% endif %}
    -- Description: {{ server_data.description | default("No description provided by Smithery.") }}
    {% if server_data.tools %}
    -- Provides Tool Functions:
    {% for mcp_tool_item in server_data.tools %}
    --- `{{ mcp_tool_item.name }}`: {{ mcp_tool_item.description | default("No tool function description.") }}
    {% endfor %}
    {% else %}
    --- No specific tool functions listed by Smithery for this server.
    {% endif %}
    {% set stdio_conn = (server_data.raw_smithery_response.connections | selectattr('type', 'equalto', 'stdio') | first)
    %}
    {% if stdio_conn and stdio_conn.configSchema and stdio_conn.configSchema.properties and
    stdio_conn.configSchema.required %}
    {% set required_props = [] %}
    {% for prop_name in stdio_conn.configSchema.required %}
    {% if prop_name in stdio_conn.configSchema.properties %}
    {% set _ = required_props.append(prop_name) %}
    {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
    {% if required_props %}
    - Note: If this server is configured via `stdio` in `.mcp.json`, it may require environment variables (e.g., `{{
    required_props | map('upper') | join(', ') }}`) to be set for it to function correctly. These are typically API keys
    or other secrets defined in its `configSchema`. Ensure these are available in the environment where Claude Code and
    its MCP servers are run.

# Your Task

First, thoroughly analyze all the raw project data provided above. Your goal is to infer:
- The project's primary purpose and the specific objective of this plan.
- The main programming languages, key technologies, and frameworks likely in use or required.
- A suitable project archetype (e.g., web app, backend API, library).
- Key existing files/modules and the overall project structure.
- Common development patterns and best practices relevant to this project.
- Natural boundaries for parallel work (e.g., frontend/backend, services, features).

Next, based on your inferences, create a **detailed action plan document structured for parallel execution by a Claude
Squad**. This plan will be the central coordination document. It must break down the overall objective into distinct
workstreams, each assignable to a different Claude Code instance. Each instance should be encouraged to follow the
"Explore-Plan-Act TDD Workflow" from `CLAUDE.md` for its coding tasks.

## Required Plan Structure and Content:

Your output must be a Markdown document with the following sections:

1. **Overall Objective for the Squad:**
* A clear, concise statement of what the entire Claude Squad aims to achieve collaboratively.

2. **Project Context:**
* A brief summary of the project's purpose, technologies, and architecture.
* Key files, modules, and components relevant to this plan.
* Any constraints or requirements that must be considered.

3. **Workstream Definitions:** (The core of the document)
* Break down the objective into 2-5 distinct workstreams, each suitable for a different Claude instance.
* For each workstream, include:
* **Workstream ID & Title:** A unique identifier (e.g., "WS1") and descriptive name.
* **Assigned Role:** A clear role title for the Claude instance (e.g., "Frontend Developer", "API Engineer").
* **Objective:** What this workstream aims to accomplish.
* **Files/Components:** The specific parts of the codebase this workstream will focus on.
* **Tasks:**
* Break down the workstream objective into actionable steps for the assigned Claude instance.
* For each task: description, specific instructions (including following Explore-Plan-Act for coding), expected outcome,
verification/testing steps.
* If relevant, suggest using specific MCP tools (listed in `<smithery_mcp_data>` and detailed in `CLAUDE.md`) to
    accomplish sub-steps.
    * `- [ ]` A Markdown checklist item for each task.
    * **Dependencies on Other Workstreams:** Clearly list any tasks from *other* workstreams that must be completed
    before this workstream (or specific tasks within it) can start or finish. (e.g., "Depends on: Workstream B - Task 3
    completion. Signal: Workstream B will update this plan when `UserAuthToken` is ready.")
    * **Outputs/Deliverables for Other Workstreams:** List what this workstream will produce that other workstreams will
    consume. (e.g., "Delivers: `UserAuthToken` data structure to Workstream C")

    4. **Integration Points & Strategy:**
    * Describe how the outputs of different parallel workstreams will be integrated.
    * Identify key integration milestones or checkpoints.
    * `- [ ]` Checklist items for integration tasks.

    5. **Overall Testing & QA Strategy for the Squad:**
    * How will the integrated solution be tested?
    * Responsibilities for different types of testing (e.g., one instance focuses on integration tests after components
    are delivered).
    * `- [ ]` Checklist items for overall QA.

    6. **Coordination & Communication Guidelines (Brief):**
    * Remind users that Claude instances should refer to `CLAUDE.md` for project-wide standards, detailed MCP tool
    information, and the Explore-Plan-Act TDD workflow.
    * Suggest that instances update their progress in this shared plan document (by checking off tasks). Instances
    should clearly signal task completion or readiness for handoff to dependent workstreams.
    * Mention that this plan is the source of truth for task assignments and dependencies. A user can direct an instance
    by saying, "You are the [Assigned Role], please perform your tasks in [Workstream Title/ID] as outlined in this
    plan."

    ## Important Guidelines for Squad Plan Generation:

    * **Parallelism is Key:** Structure the plan to maximize concurrent work.
    * **Clear Dependencies:** Make dependencies between workstreams explicit and easy to understand. This is critical
    for ordering work.
    * **Well-Defined Interfaces:** Specify how components developed in parallel will interact.
    * **Actionable Tasks within Workstreams:** Each task within a workstream should be clear and executable by a single
    Claude instance.
    * **Assignability:** The plan should be written so a human can easily say, "Claude Instance Alpha, you are the
    'Backend API Developer'. Please execute Workstream B from the plan."
    * **Reference `CLAUDE.md`:** Instruct that all instances must adhere to the project's `CLAUDE.md`.

    The final output should be ONLY the Markdown content of this detailed, squad-focused action plan.
