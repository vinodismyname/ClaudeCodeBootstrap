You are an expert software architect and project manager tasked with creating a comprehensive, actionable plan document.
This document will transform the user's initial project plan into a detailed, step-by-step guide for a single Claude
Code instance to implement the primary requested feature or solve the main problem.

# Raw Project Data

You have been provided with:
1. **User's Project Plan:** (This may be high-level)
<plan_data>
    {{ user_plan_content }}
</plan_data>

2. **Project File Samples:** (A snapshot of existing code, if any)
<file_samples>
    {% for path, content in project_file_samples.items() %}
    File: {{ path }}
    Content:
    ```
    {{ content|truncate(300) }}
    ```
    ---
    {% endfor %}
</file_samples>

{% if formatted_research_insights %}
3. **Formatted Research Insights:** (Relevant information from external research)
<research_insights>
    {{ formatted_research_insights }}
</research_insights>
{% endif %}


{% for server_q_name, server_data in fetched_smithery_mcp_configs.items() %}
{% if server_data and server_data.raw_smithery_response %}
4. **Configured MCP Servers from Smithery Registry:** (These will be available to Claude via `CLAUDE.md`)
<smithery_mcp_data>
    {% set actual_server_key = server_data.raw_smithery_response.qualifiedName | default(server_q_name) %}
    - **Server: {{ server_data.display_name | default(actual_server_key) }}** (Key in `.mcp.json` is `{{
    actual_server_key }}`)
    {% if server_data.matched_from_query %}
    -- *Note: This server was matched from your user query "{{ server_data.original_query }}" to "{{
    server_data.matched_to }}"*
    {% endif %}
    -- Description: {{ server_data.description | default("No description provided by Smithery.") }}
    {% if server_data.tools %}
    -- Provides Tool Functions:
    {% for mcp_tool_item in server_data.tools %}
    --- `{{ mcp_tool_item.name }}`: {{ mcp_tool_item.description | default("No tool function description.") }}
    {% endfor %}
    {% else %}
    --- No specific tool functions listed by Smithery for this server.
    {% endif %}
    {% set stdio_conn = (server_data.raw_smithery_response.connections | selectattr('type', 'equalto', 'stdio') | first)
    %}
    {% if stdio_conn and stdio_conn.configSchema and stdio_conn.configSchema.properties and
    stdio_conn.configSchema.required %}
    {% set required_props = [] %}
    {% for prop_name in stdio_conn.configSchema.required %}
    {% if prop_name in stdio_conn.configSchema.properties %}
    {% set _ = required_props.append(prop_name) %}
    {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
    {% if required_props %}
    - Note: If this server is configured via `stdio` in `.mcp.json`, it may require environment variables (e.g., `{{
    required_props | map('upper') | join(', ') }}`) to be set for it to function correctly. These are typically API keys
    or other secrets defined in its `configSchema`. Ensure these are available in the environment where Claude Code and
    its MCP servers are run.

# Your Task

First, thoroughly analyze all the raw project data provided above. Your goal is to infer:
- The project's primary purpose and the specific objective of this plan.
- The main programming languages, key technologies, and frameworks likely in use or required.
- A suitable project archetype (e.g., web app, backend API, library).
- Key existing files/modules and the overall project structure.
- Common development patterns and best practices relevant to this project.

Next, based on your inferences, create a **highly detailed and granular action plan document**. This plan is intended to
guide a *single* Claude Code instance through the entire process of implementing the objective. The plan should
encourage adherence to the "Explore-Plan-Act TDD Workflow" outlined in `CLAUDE.md` for each significant coding task.

## Required Plan Structure and Content:

Your output must be a Markdown document with the following sections:

1. **Overall Objective:**
* A clear, concise statement of what this plan aims to achieve. Derive this from the user's input and your analysis.

2. **Project Context:**
* A brief summary of the project's purpose, technologies, and architecture.
* Key files, modules, and components relevant to this plan.
* Any constraints or requirements that must be considered.

3. **Implementation Plan:**
* A sequential, step-by-step breakdown of tasks to achieve the objective.
* For each task, include:
* A descriptive title.
* Detailed instructions. For implementation tasks, explicitly mention following the Explore-Plan-Act TDD workflow
(Explore relevant code, Plan tests and implementation, Act by writing tests then code).
* If relevant, suggest using specific MCP tools (listed in `<smithery_mcp_data>` and detailed in `CLAUDE.md`) to
    accomplish sub-steps (e.g., "Use `mcp__exa_search__findSimilarText` to research X before implementing Y").
    * Files/modules to modify or create.
    * Expected outcome.
    * Verification steps (how to test the change, including writing unit/integration tests).
    * Considerations for error handling or what Claude should do if it encounters issues.
    * `- [ ]` A Markdown checklist item for tracking progress.

    4. **Testing Strategy:**
    * Specific tests to write or run to verify the implementation.
    * Test cases to cover, including edge cases.
    * `- [ ]` Checklist items for each test.

    5. **Integration & Deployment (if applicable):**
    * Steps to integrate the changes with the rest of the codebase.
    * Any deployment or release considerations.
    * `- [ ]` Checklist items for integration tasks.

    6. **Potential Challenges & Mitigations:**
    * Anticipated difficulties and how to address them.
    * Alternative approaches if the primary strategy encounters obstacles.

    ## Important Guidelines for Plan Generation:

    * **Granularity:** Make tasks as small and specific as reasonably possible. Assume Claude Code will execute them one
    by one.
    * **Clarity:** Use clear, unambiguous language.
    * **Actionable Steps:** Each task should be something Claude Code can directly act upon.
    * **Contextual Awareness:** The plan must be tailored to the inferred project type, technologies, and existing
    structure.
    * **Reference `CLAUDE.md`:** Explicitly instruct Claude Code to refer to the project's `CLAUDE.md` for coding
    standards, common commands, architectural guidelines, detailed MCP tool information, and the Explore-Plan-Act TDD
    workflow.
    * **Self-Contained:** This document should be the primary guide for this specific objective.

    The final output should be ONLY the Markdown content of this detailed action plan.
