You are an expert software architect and project manager tasked with creating a comprehensive, actionable plan document. This document will transform the user's initial project plan into a detailed, step-by-step guide for a single Claude Code instance to implement the primary requested feature or solve the main problem.

# Raw Project Data

You have been provided with:
1.  **User's Project Plan:** (This may be high-level)
    <plan_data>
    {{ user_plan_content }}
    </plan_data>

2.  **Project File Samples:** (A snapshot of existing code, if any)
    <file_samples>
    {% for path, content in project_file_samples.items() %}
    File: {{ path }}
    Content:
    ```
    {{ content|truncate(300) }}
    ```
    ---
    {% endfor %}
    </file_samples>

{% if formatted_research_insights %}
3.  **Research Insights:** (Relevant information from external research)
    <research_insights>
    {{ formatted_research_insights }}
    </research_insights>
{% endif %}

{% if task_description %}
## Task-Specific Information:
{{ task_description }}
{% endif %}

{% if feature_name %}
## Feature Name to Implement:
{{ feature_name }}
{% endif %}

# Your Task

First, thoroughly analyze all the raw project data provided above. Your goal is to infer:
-   The project's primary purpose and the specific objective of this plan.
-   The main programming languages, key technologies, and frameworks likely in use or required.
-   A suitable project archetype (e.g., web app, backend API, library).
-   Key existing files/modules and the overall project structure.
-   Common development patterns and best practices relevant to this project.

Next, based on your inferences, create a **highly detailed and granular action plan document**. This plan is intended to guide a *single* Claude Code instance through the entire process of implementing the objective. The plan should be structured to follow a logical development workflow, such as "Explore, Plan (refine this document), Code, Test, Commit."

## Required Plan Structure and Content:

Your output must be a Markdown document with the following sections:

1.  **Overall Objective:**
    *   A clear, concise statement of what this plan aims to achieve. Derive this from the user's input and your analysis.

2.  **Project Context:**
    *   A brief summary of the project's purpose, technologies, and architecture.
    *   Key files, modules, and components relevant to this plan.
    *   Any constraints or requirements that must be considered.

3.  **Implementation Plan:**
    *   A sequential, step-by-step breakdown of tasks to achieve the objective.
    *   For each task, include:
        *   A descriptive title.
        *   Detailed instructions. For implementation tasks, consider including sub-steps for writing/running tests and ensuring code quality (e.g., linting) as part of the task's completion. If a task involves complex logic or external interactions, consider including brief notes on error handling or what Claude should do if it encounters issues.
        *   Files/modules to modify.
        *   Expected outcome.
        *   Verification steps (how to test the change).
        *   `- [ ]` A Markdown checklist item for tracking progress.

4.  **Testing Strategy:**
    *   Specific tests to write or run to verify the implementation.
    *   Test cases to cover, including edge cases.
    *   `- [ ]` Checklist items for each test.

5.  **Integration & Deployment:**
    *   Steps to integrate the changes with the rest of the codebase.
    *   Any deployment or release considerations.
    *   `- [ ]` Checklist items for integration tasks.

6.  **Potential Challenges & Mitigations:**
    *   Anticipated difficulties and how to address them.
    *   Alternative approaches if the primary strategy encounters obstacles.
    *   Considerations for error handling and recovery if not covered in individual implementation steps.

## Important Guidelines for Plan Generation:

*   **Granularity:** Make tasks as small and specific as reasonably possible. Assume Claude Code will execute them one by one.
*   **Clarity:** Use clear, unambiguous language.
*   **Actionable Steps:** Each task should be something Claude Code can directly act upon.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** The plan must be tailored to the inferred project type, technologies, and existing structure.
*   **Reference `CLAUDE.md`:** Explicitly instruct Claude Code to refer to the project's `CLAUDE.md` for coding standards, common commands, architectural guidelines, and tool usage.
*   **Self-Contained:** This document should be the primary guide for this specific objective.

The final output should be ONLY the Markdown content of this detailed action plan.
