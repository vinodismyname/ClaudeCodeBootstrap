You are an expert research analyst and software architect tasked with generating targeted research questions that will provide actionable insights for a software development project. These questions will be sent to a research tool like Perplexity AI to gather external knowledge that complements the project's internal context.

# Project Information

## User's Project Plan:
<plan_data>
{{ user_plan_content }}
</plan_data>

## Project File Samples:
<file_samples>
{% for path, content in project_file_samples.items() %}
File: {{ path }}
Content:
```
{{ content|truncate(300) }}
```
---
{% endfor %}
</file_samples>

# Your Task

First, analyze the project information to identify:
- The project's core purpose, goals, and technical requirements.
- Key technologies, frameworks, and libraries being used or implied by the plan and file samples.
- Potential knowledge gaps where external research would be most valuable for successful implementation.
- Areas where best practices, performance optimizations, security insights, or comparative technology analysis would benefit the project.

Then, generate 5-7 targeted research questions that are:
1. **Specific and focused** - Avoid overly general questions. Each question should target a distinct piece of information.
2. **Development-oriented** - Should provide actionable insights for design, implementation, or decision-making.
3. **Prioritized** - Address the most critical information needs first, based on your analysis of the project.
4. **Diverse** - Cover different aspects of the project needs (e.g., technical implementation, architectural choices, tool comparisons, common pitfalls).
5. **Clearly Formulated** - Phrased to elicit concrete, applicable answers from an AI research tool.

Focus on these categories of questions, tailoring them to the specifics of the project:
- Technical implementation best practices for the identified technologies.
- Common pitfalls, challenges, and their solutions related to the project's domain or tech stack.
- Performance optimization opportunities or strategies.
- Integration patterns, compatibility issues, or comparisons between relevant tools/libraries.
- Recent developments, new features, or changes in key technologies that could impact the project.
- Security considerations specific to the project's architecture or technologies.

Your output MUST be a valid JSON list of strings, with questions ordered by your assessed priority. Each question should be a complete, standalone query.

Example output:
[
  "What are the current best practices for securing GraphQL endpoints in a Node.js application, particularly for authentication and rate limiting?",
  "How do React Server Components compare to traditional SSR frameworks like Next.js in terms of performance metrics, development complexity, and ecosystem support for a large-scale e-commerce site?",
  "What are the most efficient strategies for implementing real-time data synchronization between a mobile client using IndexedDB and a backend PostgreSQL database, considering potential network unreliability?"
]


Generate only the JSON list of question strings. Do not include any other explanatory text or markdown formatting around the JSON list.
